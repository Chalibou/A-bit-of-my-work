# # A-bit-of-my-work
>Samples of code I wrote to allow you to check my knowledge of the art !

Hi! In this repository you may find some pieces of work I have done in the past, this aim to demonstrate some of my humble skills in programmation. Stay tuned, this list may expand sometimes !

*This list is not exhaustive and you may understand some data have been censored. You should not be able to find the nukes launch code inside those files (or do you ?)*


# Fullstack projects

*Sooner or later, when I feel satisfied about one of my projects, it will appear right here :*  ----> X <----


# Javascript//NodeJS

## A Simple yet effective NodeJS Server with database and SocketIO

I like to maintain the things Vanilla. This sample is simple and allow http request handling, while providing some socketIO features and a simple CSV database handling. Good start for your web app Back-end or if you want to learn some tricks !

## A fancy HTML table generator

This is some kind of DIY framework to provide tables from an array, this version is built around an AJAX request, which bundle may be found below !

## AJAX handler

This AJAX client-side handler is simple yet practical, i use this very often and may be helpful while console.log() debugging.


# Visual basic for Application 

We all have to start at some point. I learnt BASIC when I was 10, unfortunately I could not use it professionally but I went through some repetitive task some day and decided Excel would do it for me and here I go learning VBA !

## Risk management Excel App

This Excel file allow you to create and manage the risks of your project through a simple interface, handle generation of reporting, setups, and some practical things.

## Excel "database" parsing

Already worked with an "Excel Database" of 10 000 lines ? Then your boss who can't figure how to do a research in Excel *(Ctrl + F by the way)* asks you : "Can you make some magic with this sh#$ ?" Here is the result, a simple UI, yet effective.

## Textile Table Converter

While reading a report, a bit of sprinkles make all the difference between : 

*"You are already boring me"* 
and 
*"I am just gonna read this sexy table"*

If your communication or shared work corporative application deals with Textile, you may be able to Copy paste your already formatted gorgeous spreadsheet from Excel to Textile format thanks to this.

## Some other things...

Did you know you can diffuse some modules between several Excel users on the same network without using  a clunky add-on ? Well you just have to copy paste some code and here you go. This way you can modify your source code without re-deploying you excel file. 
Here you will find the source code and some others !
